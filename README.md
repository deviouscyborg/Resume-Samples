# Resumes
Let's make an ocean of resume samples.

## Aim

This repository should eventually contain a lot of resume samples. We all know that we can create simple resumes using languages like HTML and CSS, but here we are trying to do something different. Let's think of creating a resume in python or C or Java or any other language which will print your resume in terminal or maybe you create a GUI using Java and display your informataion in that. Possibilities are endless!

## Example

Here is my sample resume in Python

```python
name = 'Vaibhav Pandey'
title = 'CSE UNDERGRADUATE'
skills = ['Web Development']
print(name)
print(title)
print('Skills:')
for i in skills:
  print(i)
```

This is another one in HTML

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset='utf-8'>
    <meta http-equiv='X-UA-Compatible' content='IE=edge'>
    <title>Page Title</title>
    <meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1'>
    <link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' media='screen' href='main.css'>
    <script src='main.js'></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Vaibhav Pandey</h1>
    <h2>CSE UNDERGRADUATE</h2>
    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Web Development</li>
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```
